### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe Schendel, and I am an aerospace engineering student at Iowa State University. I have created this account for class, but I am interested in learning  new coding languages. So far, I have only learned Python and Matlab. I want to learn more languages because coding is interesting to me, and I find it somewhat  calming to write code. 

I am not currently working on any projects, but I am the president of Tau Beta Pi's Iowa Alpha chapter. Tau Beta Pi is a national engineering honors society. In my spare time, you can find me in the gym working out, playing basketball at my appartment complex, or playing video games on my PC.
